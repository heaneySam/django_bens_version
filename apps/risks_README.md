This set up is designed for managing multiple types of insurance risks in a modular and extensible way. Let's break it down! 

**1. `risks_core` (The Foundation)**

*   **Purpose:** This app provides the **common foundation** and **shared logic/data structures** for all risk types in your application. It ensures consistency and reduces redundancy.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `models.py`:
        *   `RiskBase`: This is an **abstract base model**. It defines fields that are common to *all* risk types (e.g., `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`). Any new, specific risk type you create will inherit these common fields from `RiskBase`. This directly addresses your requirement that "Some parts of these risks are common."
        *   `RiskQuerySet`: A custom QuerySet that can be used to add common filtering logic for all risk models (e.g., the `owned_by` method to filter risks by the user who created them).
    *   `services.py`:
        *   `get_registered_risk_types()`: This service function is crucial. It returns a list of URL segments (like `'credit-political'`, `'directors-officers'`) that represent the currently available and "registered" risk classes in your system. This allows other parts of the application (like the `risks` app) to dynamically discover what types of risks are supported.

**In essence, `risks_core` defines *what it means to be a risk* in your system, outlining the shared characteristics and providing central services for managing risk types.**

**2. `risks_credit_political` (A Specific Risk Type Implementation)**

*   **Purpose:** This app (and others like `risks_directors_officers`) implements a **concrete, specific type of insurance risk**. It builds upon the foundation laid by `risks_core`.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `models.py`:
        *   `CreditPoliticalRisk(RiskBase)`: This is the model for "Credit & Political Risks." Notice it **inherits from `RiskBase`** (from `risks_core.models`). This means it automatically gets all the common fields defined in `RiskBase`. It then adds fields that are *specific* to credit and political risks (e.g., `insured`, `country_of_insured`, `product`, `status`, `score`).
    *   `serializers.py`:
        *   `CreditPoliticalRiskSerializer`: This handles the conversion of `CreditPoliticalRisk` model instances to JSON (and vice-versa) for your API. It knows about both the inherited fields from `RiskBase` and the specific fields of `CreditPoliticalRisk`.
    *   `services.py`:
        *   `CreditPoliticalRiskService`: This layer contains the business logic for `CreditPoliticalRisk` operations (like creating, retrieving, updating, deleting). It centralizes ORM calls, making your views cleaner and your logic more testable.
    *   `views.py`:
        *   `CreditPoliticalRiskViewSet`: This provides the API endpoints (e.g., for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests) for managing `CreditPoliticalRisk` objects. It uses the `CreditPoliticalRiskService` for data operations and the `CreditPoliticalRiskSerializer` for data representation.
    *   `urls.py`:
        *   This file defines the URL patterns that map to the `CreditPoliticalRiskViewSet`. For example, requests to `/api/risks/credit-political/` would be routed here. It also includes nested routes for managing attachments related to a specific credit/political risk.

**In essence, `risks_credit_political` (and similar apps) provides the detailed implementation for one particular category of risk, including its unique data fields, business logic, and API endpoints.**

**3. `risks` (The Aggregator and Router)**

*   **Purpose:** This app acts as the **main entry point and router** for all risk-related functionalities. It doesn't manage any specific risk type itself but rather directs traffic and provides an overview.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `views.py`:
        *   `RiskClassListView`: This API view is responsible for listing all available risk classes. It does this by calling the `get_registered_risk_types()` service from `risks_core.services`. This allows the frontend or other API consumers to discover what types of risks (e.g., "credit-political", "directors-officers") the backend supports.
    *   `urls.py`:
        *   The root path (`''`) within this app's URLs is mapped to `RiskClassListView`, so a request to `/api/risks/` (assuming this is your base path) would list the available risk classes.
        *   More importantly, it uses `include()` to **delegate URL patterns to the specific risk apps**. For example, `path('credit-political/', include('apps.risks_credit_political.urls'))` means that any URL starting with `/api/risks/credit-political/` will be handled by the `urls.py` file within the `risks_credit_political` app.

**In essence, the `risks` app is like a switchboard. It tells you what risk types are available (using information from `risks_core`) and then routes requests for a specific risk type to the appropriate specialized app (like `risks_credit_political`).**

**How it All Works Together (The Flow):**

1.  A frontend application might first hit an endpoint like `/api/risks/` (handled by `risks.urls` and `risks.views.RiskClassListView`).
2.  `RiskClassListView` calls `risks_core.services.get_registered_risk_types()` to get a list like `['credit-political', 'directors-officers']`. This list is returned to the frontend.
3.  The frontend now knows it can interact with "credit-political" risks. If it wants to fetch all credit-political risks, it would make a GET request to `/api/risks/credit-political/`.
4.  The main project `urls.py` (not shown, but assumed) routes `/api/risks/` to `apps.risks.urls`.
5.  `apps.risks.urls` sees `credit-political/` and delegates the rest of the path to `apps.risks_credit_political.urls`.
6.  `apps.risks_credit_political.urls` maps this request to its `CreditPoliticalRiskViewSet`, which then uses its associated service and serializer to process the request and return the data.

**Difference Between `risks` and `risks_core`:**

*   **`risks_core` is about the *definition and shared nature* of risks.**
    *   It defines the common data structure (`RiskBase`).
    *   It provides services that are fundamental to the risk system (like knowing what types are registered).
    *   It **does not** have API endpoints for specific risk types.
*   **`risks` is about *access and aggregation* of different risk types.**
    *   It provides an entry point to discover available risk types.
    *   It routes incoming API requests to the correct specialized risk app.
    *   It **does not** know the specific details of any single risk type, nor does it define their common structure.

This separation of concerns makes your application:

*   **Modular:** Each risk type is self-contained in its own app.
*   **Extensible:** Adding a new risk type (e.g., "Cyber Risk") involves:
    1.  Creating a new app (e.g., `apps.risks_cyber`).
    2.  Defining its model, inheriting from `risks_core.models.RiskBase`.
    3.  Implementing its specific serializers, services, views, and URLs.
    4.  Registering the new risk type's URL segment in `risks_core.services.get_registered_risk_types()`.
    5.  Including its URLs in `apps.risks.urls.py`.
*   **Maintainable:** Changes to common risk features are made in `risks_core`. Changes to a specific risk type are isolated to its app.
